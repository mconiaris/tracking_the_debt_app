Research List:
1. Role of NPM vs. Grunt
2. Angular/Bootstrap. How is it different from using it seperately?


Questions:
- does grunt-angular-templates need to be in dependencies as well as devdependencies?
- what does bower.json do in comparison to package.json. They seem to conflict.


Error List:
1. xcode-select: error: tool 'xcodebuild' requires Xcode, but active developer directory '/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools' is a command line tools instance
2. UNMET PEER DEPENDENCY jasmine-core@*
3. UNMET PEER DEPENDENCY phantomjs@>=1.9
