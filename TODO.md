Grunt Templates:
- Stack Overflow: Is there a way to make AngularJS load partials in the beginning and not at when needed?: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12346690/is-there-a-way-to-make-angularjs-load-partials-in-the-beginning-and-not-at-when

Research List:
1. Role of NPM vs. Grunt
2. Angular/Bootstrap. How is it different from using it seperately?
- First steps on building a Single Page App with AngularJS: http://helabs.com/blog/2014/06/13/first-steps-on-building-a-spa-with-angularjs/


Questions:
- does grunt-angular-templates need to be in dependencies as well as devdependencies?
- what does bower.json do in comparison to package.json. They seem to conflict.


Error List:
1. xcode-select: error: tool 'xcodebuild' requires Xcode, but active developer directory '/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools' is a command line tools instance
