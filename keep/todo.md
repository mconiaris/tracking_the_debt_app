To Do Items for this App:
- add tests for controllers and views
- make choices more obvious (checkboxes instead of links?)
- add footer with instruction (double tap to return to screen, hold and select for detail)
- Make small screen version of my project. Send to Liz.
- add teases and annotations to pieces of data (bullet points or balloons which popped up with anecdotal facts or history).
- Difference between controller and link: http://jasonmore.net/angular-js-directives-difference-controller-link/

On Show View:
- back button should go on top of screen
- need simple breadcrumb navigation
- show column should be on the left side and should read "view". Make it hyperlink color?



Feedback to conider:
- I love some of the information in your  "about" section and wonder if you could move some of it to the main page.
- I would close up the space between your main headline of "Tracking the Debt" and your sub headline of "Charting US receipts..."
At first glance I thought it was 2 separate things.  I'd like to see it look more like a NY Times Headline of a main headline with a small sub headline right underneath.
- I would move "Home" "About" and "Historical tables over to one side and stack them on top of each other in a different color to make it stand out making a 3rd color
- I would also use different color for 1 and 2.  They were very similar brown/tan and did not help to position my eyes to the content.
