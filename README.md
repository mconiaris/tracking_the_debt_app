#Tracking the Debt App

##What This Is
This is my final project for [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/new-york-city) August 2014 [Web Development Immersive](https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive). It is meant to be a quick and simple demonstration of what I have learned, while giving me some needed additional front-end development experience.

##Technical Details
This app was written in Ruby version ruby 2.1.2 using Ruby on Rails version 4.1.6.

The heart of the application, the charts, uses the [Dygraphs](http://dygraphs.com/) Javascript library with some jQuery thrown in for convienence.

A PosgreSQL version 9.3.5 database is set up and a seed file created, although this verison does not use it. It is my intention to add some dynamic calls that will enable the user to generate charts with limited date ranges. There was not enough time to get that working for this version though.

In a future iteration, I plan on using rspec and Capybara tests.

##How to run the test suite
Start up a Rails server in the folder of this code and it should run (I hope).
