To Do Items for this App:
- Make small screen version of my project. Send to Liz.


Suggestions:
- if there were bullet points or balloons which popped up with anecdotal facts or history or something like that, it might tell a story a bit better.

- I love some of the information in your  "about" section and wonder if you could move some of it to the main page.


- I would close up the space between your main headline of "Tracking the Debt" and your sub headline of "Charting US receipts..."
At first glance I thought it was 2 separate things.  I'd like to see it look more like a NY Times Headline of a main headline with a small sub headline right underneath.

- I would move "Home" "About" and "Historical tables over to one side and stack them on top of each other in a different color to make it stand out making a 3rd color

- I would also use different color for 1 and 2.  They were very similar brown/tan and did not help to position my eyes to the content.
